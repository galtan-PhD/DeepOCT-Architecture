# DeepOCT-Architecture


## Deep Autoencoder with Extreme Learning Machines

<div>
The script helps to train and test DeepOCT architecture. <br>
The DeepOCT is an optical coherence tomography analysis architecture, that is based on Convolutional neural network, to perform identification of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) against nonDME using the detailed analysis capabilities of Deep Learning.  

The paper of the projet is under review. Therefore, the repository has limitations in using a complete analysis.
The current version of the repository is consists of 
  
  1- Constant files for DeepOCT parameters
  2- A limited version of preprocessing procedure
  3- Keras implementation for DeepOCT architecture
  4- Training procedure with classification parameters 
  5- Test file that prepares a raw OCT image for DeepOCT.


*The paper is in review process, the complete preprocessing steps and optimum weight od DeepOCT ('deepOCTmodel.h5') will be added to the repository after a publication.
